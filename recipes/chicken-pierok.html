    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These chicken pierogi have a rich, flavorful ground chicken filling folded into dough wrappers, pan fried, and served with sour cream and chives.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tsp mustard</li>
        <li>1 tbsp mayonaisse</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 green onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>&frac12; tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>&frac12; tsp pepper</li>
        <li>12 oz round dough wrappers, 2 &frac12; inches in diameter (about 50-60 wrappers)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil or high-heat cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <!-- Add Step1 Step2 etc on my steps list -->
    <ol>
        <li>Combine ground chicken, eggs, mustard, mayonnaise, parsley, green onions, paprika, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Stir with a large spoon until well combined.</li>
        <li>Assemble the pierogi: Work with 3-4 dough wrappers at a time. Lay them out on a clean surface. Spoon a tablespoon amount of filling in the middle of each wrapper. Dab your finger in a small dish of water and encircle the edges of the wrapper (this will help the dough stick together.) Fold the dough in half and bring the edges together. Crimp the edges of each pierogi by pinching them with your fingers to make sure they are well sealed. Transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet or large plate. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook the pierogi: Heat 3 tbsp of oil in pan over medium/low heat. Add 6-8 pierogi at a time to the pan, making sure you don't overcrowd the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side, until golden and chicken is cooked though. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining pierogi. Add additional oil as needed. Serve with sour cream and garnish with chives.</li>

        
    </ol>

    <h2>Recipe Notes:</h2>
    
    <ul>
